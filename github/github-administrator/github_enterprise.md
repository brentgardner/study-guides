## Issues Supported

#### Account

Human error-related authentication problems are an example of account issues. When a user is locked out of their account and failed to retain keys to back up their two-factor authentication process, GitHub technical support can help you prove the user's identity.

#### Security

You can request GitHub support when responding to threat actors hacking an account. If the problem is a security issue, GitHub support technicians can provide help in rolling back damage to organization repositories and settings.

#### Abuse

Abuse issues involve responding to violations of the site's terms of service or organizational policies in GitHub's social setting--someone is using GitHub's communication's features to abuse other users. GitHub support technicians can help you evaluate the situation and can remove harmful content or ban abusive actors.  On the other hand, you should deal with some issues internally. You should administer tasks like integrating CI/CD servers or internal tools, hardware setup, writing scripts, configuring Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or other external authentication systems, working with Open Source projects, resolving problems that require immediate intervention, and running command-line utilities (except ghe-dbconsole).

### Prioritization

- Urgent tickets report critical system failure.
- High-tickets report problems impacting business operations or critical bugs, including removing sensitive data (commits, issues, pull requests, uploaded attachments) from your own accounts and organization restorations.
- Normal-tickets request account recovery or spam unflagging, report user sign in issues, and report noncritical bugs.
- Low-tickets ask general questions and submit requests for new features, purchases, training, or health checks.
