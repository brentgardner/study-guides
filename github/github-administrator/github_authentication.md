# GitHub's authentication

## Authentication Methods

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Username and password | Known as "basic" HTTP authentication.  Not recommended. |
| Personal access tokens (PATs) | An alternative to using passwords for Github authentication with the API or CLI. |
| SSH Keys | As an alternative to using personal access tokens, users can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services via SSH with the help of SSH keys. SSH keys eliminate the need for users to supply their username and personal access token for every interaction. You can even use SSH keys with a repository owned by an organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO). If the organization provides SSH certificates, users can also use it to access the organization's repositories without adding the certificate to their GitHub account. |
| Deploy Keys | Deploy keys are another type of SSH key in GitHub that grants a user access to a single repository. GitHub attaches the public part of the key directly to the repository instead of a personal user account, and the private part of the key remains on the user's server. Deploy keys are read-only by default, but you can give them write access when adding them to a repository. |

## Two-factore Authentication (MFA)

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| SMS    | a code sent via text and used in combination with a user name and password. GitHub doesn't support authentication via SMS in all countries/regions. |
| TOTP   | a code generated by authenticatior or other apps that are synce based on a code and time.  These are used in combination with a user name and password.  More reliable than SMS. |
| SECUIRTY KEYS | Authentication with a security key requires that TOTP (Time-based one-time password) or SMS authentication has already been completed. On most devices, you can use a physical security key over USB or NFC. A user can register a new security key by accessing their profile setting and following the security keyâ€™s documentation. Using these keys is the most secure form of 2FA, because they're nearly impossible for a malicious party to replicate. When using a security key, none of the sensitive information ever leaves the physical security key device. Authentication with a security key is the most secure way to authenticate, but your users will need to complete one of the following authentication methods to configure the key. |

## SAML SSO 

When users access resources within an organization that uses SAML SSO, GitHub will redirect them to the organization's SAML IdP for authentication. After they successfully authenticate with their account on the IdP, the IdP redirects to GitHub to access the organization's resources. GitHub offers limited support for all identity providers that implement the SAML 2.0 standard with official support for several popular identity providers including:

- Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).
- Microsoft Entra ID.
- Okta.
- OneLogin.
- PingOne.

## LDAP

Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is a popular application protocol for accessing and maintaining directory information services. LDAP lets you authenticate GitHub Enterprise Server against your existing accounts and centrally manage repository access. It's one of the most common protocols used to integrate third-party software with large company user directories.

GitHub Enterprise Server integrates with popular LDAP services like:
- Active Directory.
- Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition.
- OpenLDAP.
- Open Directory.

## SCIM ( System for Cross-domain Identity Management)

- SCIM lets you add, manage, or remove organization member access within GitHub. SCIM was developed to allow synchronization of information between an IdP and multiple applications.

- If you use SAML SSO without implementing SCIM, you won't have automatic deprovisioning.

## Team Synchronization

- Supported by **Microsoft Entra ID** and **Okta**
- With team synchronization enabled, changes made in an IdP group are automatically reflected on GitHub.
- The team slug and group name will be matched automatically, unless you define a custom mapping with syncmap.yml
- Utilize a settings file to derive Active Directory and GitHub settings

## Enterprise Managed Users

Team synchronization is also available for organizations and enterprise accounts that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud. Enterprise Managed Users is a feature of GitHub Enterprise Cloud that provides even greater control over enterprise members and resources.

When you use Enterprise Managed Users, all members are provisioned and managed through your IdP. Users don't create their own accounts on GitHub. You can manage organization and team membership by using groups on your IdP. Managed user accounts are restricted to their enterprise and can't push code, collaborate, or interact with users, repositories, or organizations outside of their enterprise.
